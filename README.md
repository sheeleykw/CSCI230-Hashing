# CSCI230-Hashing
The main goal of this code is to calculate the number of successful and unsuccessful searches using both an Open-Hashing and a Closed-Hashing function.
Once the main method in the "TestHashing" file is run, the output for the number of successful and unsuccessful searches will be displayed in the console.
# Edits
Switched from displaying all the values of successful and unsuccessful searches to the average value.
